People often react with surprise when I tell them about this shift. But they reacted similarly back when I switched from studying Computer Science to Ethnology. Admittedly, that was a bigger leap. In this blog post, I want to share how I made these jumps, the extent of these jumps, how I trained for them, and where I landed.<br>\n<br><br>\nIt all started at the age of 12 when I decided not to just passively consume Nintendogs and Pok√©mon on my Nintendo DS but to actively contribute to spreading these immensely important cultural resources. I dove into the then-thriving scene of youthful web designers and created a website about Nintendogs and Pok√©mon. Naturally, the site was only visited by kids who already knew these games, so I probably didn't manage to spread their popularity. However, it ignited my passion for web design, and I created several websites and designs with ever-growing skills and technologies until graduation. After my volunteer service in Tanzania, studying Computer Science and jobs as a web designer and software developer were no-brainers.<br>\n<br><br>\nYet, I got distracted ‚Äì I stumbled into an Ethnology module and was fascinated by the prevailing philosophy that there's no right or wrong and everything must be seen relative to its context. I found this very enlightening and was eager to deconstruct my worldview and question my assumptions. I lived in various countries, learning their languages and cultures. During my master's in Cultural Anthropology, I ended up working for an NGO in the sustainable coffee trade sector, thus landing in the field of international cooperation, where I saw my future at the time. There, I discovered that bureaucracy and writing grant proposals that reinforce power structures were not for me. Working in an international team: Yay! Finding nice words for questionable projects under a charitable guise: Nay.<br>\n<br><br>\nSimultaneously, Artificial Intelligence finally conquered the world and reached the mainstream. I had a lot of fun with Chat GPT and its nonsensical poems and decided I wanted to understand how exactly this chatbot could entertain me so wonderfully. I quickly rediscovered my passion for programming and sank into my enthusiasm and office chair. I started the course, <a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com/career-journey/data-scientist-ml\">‚ÄúData Scientist: Machine Learning‚Äù career path on Codecademy</a>, where I learned everything about Machine Learning from Python and SQL, data cleaning, statistics, supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms, to pandas, scikit-learn, and data visualization.<br>\n<br><br>\nAdditionally, my study of Cultural Anthropology provides a unique perspective and an additional skill set for data processing. The sensitivity to realities of life, individual truths, and contexts is a huge advantage throughout the entire data processing journey, from project conception, data collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation. There‚Äôs hardly any field that scrutinizes and questions one's own bias or preconceptions more than Cultural Anthropology. Also, the many experiences with planning and implementing projects in this study will be a great help in the field of Machine Learning.<br>\n<br><br>\nMy first project, paying homage to cats with a <a href=\"https://github.com/artificialintellicat/cat-breed-classifier\">Cat Breed Classifier</a>, convinced me once and for all that this field is exactly what my heart beats for and how I want to spend my professional life: Yes, I do! There‚Äôs simply nothing better than having a big challenge in front of you, solving it step by step, constantly learning new things, and growing beyond yourself.<br>\n<br><br>\nNow that I‚Äôve completed the <a href=\"https://portfolio-website-jade-kappa.vercel.app/data_scientist_certificate.pdf\">Data Scientist Machine Learning course</a> and as I continue working on my portfolio, I am applying for jobs in the Machine Learning sector, hoping someone will give me a chance to prove how passionate I am about this topic and the constant, lifelong process of solving challenges and learning. üòä</p>\n"}},"__N_SSG":true}
